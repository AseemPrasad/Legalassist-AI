The challenge is the Information Barrier in the Judiciary that prevents citizens from understanding their own legal outcomes. 
Specifically: Court judgments are inaccessible to the public due to complex legal jargon and language diversity.
 
This barrier leads to: 
1. Lack of trust in the judicial system. 
2. Citizen dependency on expensive, slow intermediaries for basic case 
updates.

 It must be solved by an automated, multilingual, plain-language 
translation layer applied to final judgment documents.
